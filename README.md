# overtone-roland-a300

Wrapper events for the strange way I use my Roland A-300 midi keyboard in [overtone](http://overtone.github.io/).

*Disclaimer: I am new to clojure and overtone, this project probably has some really embarassing code, and its api is subject to drastic change as I figure out how clojure and overtone actually work*
